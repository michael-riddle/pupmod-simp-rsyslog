# == Define: rsyslog::template
#
# This define allows you to add template strings to the rsyslog configuration
# file.  These rules should be uniquely named.
#
# The variables listed are as defined in the rsyslog.conf(5) man page for rules
# (not globals).
#
# You'll need to write the entire template line due to the complexity of the
# rsyslog configuration parameters.  Leading spaces will be removed.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*name*]
#   The literal name of the file that will be used to build the multi-part
#   file.
#   Note: Do not use a '/' in the $name.
#
# [*content*]
#   The rsyslog template content that you wish to add to the system.
#   This is fed, without formatting, directly into the target file.
